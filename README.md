# Monsters_Rolodex_React


Projects


Created a small web app using the create react app.
Project was programmed with intentions of learning React.
Components were created separately from the render function and stored in the SRC files.
Achieved a high understanding of the "state" of a webpage, jsx components, and what happens under the hood.
